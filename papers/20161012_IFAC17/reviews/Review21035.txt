Comments to the author
======================

This paper developed a Q-Learning algorithm for model-free
autonomous soaring, the main contributions of the proposed
approach are the parameter adjusting strategies,the
originality of the paper is poor. 

The simulation show the convergence of the algorithm and
the overall behaviro of the glider, However, the method is
not compared with other presented control method, or it has
to be outlined what is the benefit of this method. The
emphases are not clear. As presented, the paper is not
acceptable for the conference.
